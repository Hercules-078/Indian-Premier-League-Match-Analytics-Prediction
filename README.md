# Indian-Premier-League-Match-Analytics-Prediction
## Project Overview

This comprehensive data science project performs in-depth statistical analysis and machine learning-based predictions on Indian Premier League (IPL)  data. The system combines exploratory data analysis with predictive modeling to extract meaningful insights and forecast match outcomes.

## Exploratory Data Analysis 
- **Team Performance Analysis:** Identified top-performing franchises based on win rates, consistency metrics, and season-wise performance
- **Venue Insights:** Determined most popular cricket stadiums and analyzed ground-specific statistics including batting-friendly vs. bowling-friendly venues
- **Player Statistics:** Evaluated individual player contributions, including top run-scorers, leading wicket-takers, and most valuable players
- **Luck Factor Assessment:** Analyzed teams that benefited from close finishes, toss advantages, and other fortune-based elements
- **Match Dynamics:** Studied patterns in winning margins, chasing vs. defending success rates, and powerplay performances

## Predictive Modeling
- **Score Prediction:** Linear Regression, Random Forest, and SVM Regressors to forecast innings totals
- **Match Winner Prediction:** Logistic Regression, SVM, and Decision Tree Classifiers for live match outcomes
- **Feature Engineering:** Current match metrics, batsman-bowler statistics, historical performance, venue data, and head-to-head records

## Technical Implementation
**Programming Language:** Python\
**Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy\
**Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn\
**Visualization:** Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly\

## Applications
